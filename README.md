Code Cracking with a Mass Spectrometer
========================================

You will be given a series of particles of unknown masses.
The mass of each particle corresponds with the atomic mass of an element in the periodic table.
Use the chemical symbol of the element to crack the code.

E.g., a particle of mass 1.0079E-3 kg corresponds to "H" (Hydrogen).

=========================================

In our mass spectrometer simulation, the particle starts from rest. 
You can determine the magnitude and sign of the particle's charge
as well as the magnitude and direction of the electric field and magnetic field.

For an actual mass spectometer, the precise charge of each particle is unknown;
instead, one determines the mass-to-charge ratio. Additionally, not all the particles
are moles of one element. Our mass spectometer simulation likely differs from an
actual mass spectometer in many other ways, but we feel the simulation is sufficient
for a Physics demonstration.

Enjoy!


P.S. We are terrible, inexperienced programmers using Processing 
(primarily because processing.js makes our code suitable for a webpage).
